        Alexandre Magno Abrão (April 9, 1970 – March 6, 2013), better known by
        his stage name Chorão, was a Brazilian singer-songwriter, rapper,
        lyricist, guitarist, skateboarder, record and film producer,
        screenwriter and entrepreneur. Best known for being a founding member
        and the vocalist/main lyricist of the influential alternative rock band
        Charlie Brown Jr., Folha de S.Paulo critic André Barcinski considered
        him "the nearest thing to a punk hero Brazilian mainstream music ever
        had",[1] and Eduardo Tristão Girão of Portal Uai called him "the bad boy
        of Brazilian rock" and "the spokesperson of the youth of the 1990s".[2]
        Having been born and raised for most of his childhood in São Paulo,
        Chorão was the only Charlie Brown Jr. member not to hail originally from
        Santos, and its only founding member to remain consistently in all of
        the group's line-ups.
